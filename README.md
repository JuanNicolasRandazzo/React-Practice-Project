<h1>Welcome to my practice <strong>React</strong> basis repository</h1>
<p>
  In this repository, you will see in a very separate and clear way all the basic concepts of both JavaScript and React.  
</p>

  <h2>Main Folders</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong><em>aprendiendo-html</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>botyc</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>gentleman-react</em></strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>master-react</em></strong></li>

<div>
  <h2>aprendiendo-html</h2>
  <p>
    This folder shows a quick review of my HTML knowledge, getting ready all the important concepts for web development:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML Structure:</strong> Doctype Declaration, HTML Document Tree</li>
      <li><strong>Elements and Tags:</strong> Basic Elements, Formatting Elements, Grouping Content</li>
      <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Global Attributes, Specific Attributes</li>
      <li><strong>Links and Navigation:</strong> Hyperlinks, Navigation Tags</li>
      <li><strong>Images and Media:</strong> Image Tags</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>botyc</h2>
  <p>
    This folder is a personal project I am currently working on. I am using it to practice working with an API I created using Python and Django. It is not finished yet. 
  </p>

<div>
  <h2>gentleman-react</h2>
  <p>
    This project is part of a course I took on the GentlemanProgramming YouTube channel. He teaches everything you need to know to understand React and to implement good practices, 
    not just in terms of code, but also in project architecture. 
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>master-reract</h2>
  <p>
   Now we are in the most prominent folder. Inside, you will find four projects, each of which utilizes different React concepts. I use these projects to test and fully understand their functionalities.
    <ul>
      <li>01-primeros-pasos(First Steps)</li>
      <li>02-use-state</li>
      <li>03-use-effect</li>
      <li>04-forms</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
   <h2>01-primeros-pasos</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we learn the basic architecture of a React project. We understand what a component is and how to use them. 
    Additionally, we cover the declaration of functions and how to implement them within our components. 
  </p>
  <h2>02-use-state</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we learn what states are in React and how to use them. We understand how powerful and convenient they are as a concept and in a practical way nowadays.  
  </p>

  <h2>03-use-effect</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we introduce the concept of a Hook, and how it facilitates the coding experience. Als,o its versatility and cleanliness when reading the code.  
  </p>

  <h2>04-forms</h2>
  <p>
    Finally, in this project, we combine all the previously learned concepts by using a form. We retrieve the information entered into the form and display it on the screen.

  <h1>This project will continue to evolve as my React knowledge and practice improve. Stay tuned! </h1>
